**List of Programs to be done for Lab Manual**

1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.
2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
3. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris data set.
4. Apply k-Means  algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file.
5. Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file.
6. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
7. Implement the Linear Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select the appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
8. Implement the Logistic Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select the appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
9. Write a program to construct a Support Vector Machine model. Select the appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
